This was a wordpress plugin created with SVGs

###How this plugin works:
The client’s previous site had a flash element that did this same thing, but of course we couldn’t use it. I took the artwork of the man and put him into illustrator. I traced all the paths to create all the fill paths for the man front and man back. Then grouped each area with an id. After, exported as an SVG to have each element with an ID.
